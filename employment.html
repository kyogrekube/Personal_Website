                <h1>Position: Intern</h1>
                <h1>Time Period: June 2023 - August 2023</h1>
                <p>Surveyed a suitable hydropower site, modeled pre- and post-construction river 
                    flows, created a program using Python to automate the process, developed 
                    control schema for a hydropower plant, and wrote a request for proposal to 
                    build a control system. This was to study and codify how a system will behave 
                    under conditions at a specific site. This involved studying the flow dynamics 
                    of waterways where plants are under consideration, and optimization and 
                    regulation of the damping and control of the operation. Learned how to use Excel.</p>
