                <h2>FIJI Island Week (April 17th - 21st 2023)</h2>
                <p>FIJI Island Week is a week long set of philantrhopy events that raise money for 
                    a preestablished cause. As the current philantrhopy chair, I wanted to push our
                    chapter to raise more money than any individual previous year. Spring 2023 was 
                    the 5th ever Island Week at our school, and our most successful year brought in
                    a total of $1,425.00 which went towards the victims of the Fourth St. and 
                    Washington St. fires. This fire displaced 9 families and over 25 people. Since 
                    2022, our organization has supported Joesph's House and Shelter, which provides
                     emergency shelter and support services to a yearly average of 3,000 men, women
                    , and children. By the end of the week, our organization raised a total of 
                    $2128.02, which by far was our best year.</p>
